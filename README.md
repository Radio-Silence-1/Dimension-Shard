# Dimension-Shard
This is a mindustry mod of the outdated mod "Dimension Shard"'s spawnable core. 

Due to me being bad at code, it does not show how many items it required to spawn the core, to find that, look in the description of the block. 

# Disclaimer
I didnt make this mod, abomb4 has credit for ideas, textures
The original repo can be found here. https://github.com/abomb4/dimension-shard

Also, I do not in any way take full credit for this idea to remake the mod, or full credit for remaking it. The idea was not mine, and I had a lot of help from the mindustry discord.
